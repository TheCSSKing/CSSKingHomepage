      The Truth: There is no benefit to javascript, only blight, and extra kilobytes (Kiloblights).

      MY ROYAL DECREE

      <!--       Thanks too: https://codepen.io/efost/pen/rrjvkk -->
      <div class="decree">       
        <p><span class="caps">A</span>ll can be accomplished through the power of Pure CSS&trade;.  There is no feature or dynamic event that can not be implemented in the one true language.  Developers fight amongst themselves to determine the best <span class="strike">Javascript</span> framework, yet they do not realize the power that has been at their fingertips all along.</p>
        
        <p>Woe be unto him who uses the script tag.  It is a tempting fruit, gleaming in the eye of the developer, yet it is poison.  One script tag leads to two, leads to three, and soon your website is bogged down under the weight of a thousand kiloblights.  There is no salvation in the dark shadow of <span class="strike">Javascript</span>, only lag and feature creep.  It is not too late to turn to the light of Pure CSS&trade;.</p>
          
        <p>I am a kind and merciful ruler. I welcome of all of my lost sheep back to the fold with open brackets.  I too was once seduced by the script-side.  It is a painful journey of listening to events and reacting to changes.  In the dark world of <span class="strike">Javascript</span>, the developer console can seem like your only friend.  Yet, you must know that there is somebody for you, somebody who has been there all along.  The one true language: Pure CSS&trade;.</p>

      This represents the normal development lifecycle.  You start with one or two scripts, then end up with more requests than there are
      atoms in the universe.
